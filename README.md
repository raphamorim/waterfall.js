# Waterfall.js

> Tired of using creepy hacks or heavy ways to get a grid based on Pinterest?

1KB and works without any dependency, also [UMD support available too](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) \o/

## The "Why"

Currently the best option today to do this job is Masonry, but it's very heavy and has a jQuery dependency. Please understand: this isn't a problem in most cases, but when perfomance and page weight matters, it's best to try other options: maybe pure CSS? Is it possible?

This question has a good point. Yes, there are CSS ways to solve this, using flexbox or columns technic, but this doesn't work well when you don't know about your data/structure. So we have to use JavaScript. The challenge is create a decent algorithm where the structure doesn't matter: Waterfall will work.

However; Waterfall always will consider items with **same width** :)

## How to Use?

#### Getting

First at all, get Waterfall using [Download Option](https://github.com/raphamorim/waterfall.js/archive/master.zip) or via bower.

To get using [Bower](http://bower.io) just run this command

```sh
bower install waterfall
```

Or get it using NPM by running this command

```sh
npm install waterfall.js
```

You can import

```js
import waterfall from 'waterfall.js'
```

Or add the source before the closing body tag:

```html
<script src="waterfall.min.js"></script>
</body>
```

Another option: Waterfall.js is currently available in cdnjs, so you can use it from there too.

```html
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/waterfall.js/1.0.2/waterfall.min.js"></script>
</body>
```

Another option: Waterfall.js is also available in unpkg, so you can use it from there too.
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/waterfall.js/dist/waterfall.umd.min.js"></script>
</body>
```

#### Usage

Define your grid structure:

```html
<div class="grid">
    <div class="item">Solid Snake</div>
    <div class="item">Riou</div>
    <div class="item">Jack Russel</div>
</div>
```

Call Waterfall function with your grid as a argument and let the magic happen :)

```javascript

waterfall('.grid');
// or
var grid = document.querySelector('.grid');
waterfall(grid);

```

#### Responsive

Just call Waterfall function again on window resize event:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('resize', function () {
    waterfall(grid);
});
```

#### Many images to load

In this case we highly recommend you run the waterfall only after the images have been loaded. Because Waterfall.js requires information about height / width of the images.

A quick solution is to use [imgStatus](http://raphamorim.io/imgStatus/) (no dependencies and only 855bytes) to check the images were loaded.
